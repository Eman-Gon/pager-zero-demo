# Incident: off-by-one loop boundary in sumRiskWeights (src/riskScore.ts).
# Changes `i < codes.length` to `i <= codes.length`, which reads one
# element past the end of the codes array on every call. The extra
# undefined code falls through to the default weight of 1, inflating
# every risk score by 1 and cascading into pricing, approval, and the
# top-level processClaim summary.
